### What I learned

In the process of developing my recipe page project, I embarked on a journey to enhance my understanding of CSS styling techniques. One significant aspect I delved into was the manipulation of list markers. Through research and experimentation, I discovered the power of CSS pseudo-elements, particularly `::marker`, which allowed me to target and style list markers with precision.

Learning to increase the weight and font size of list markers was an insightful endeavor. I explored various CSS properties such as `font-size` and `font-weight` to achieve the desired visual impact. By applying these properties selectively to the `::marker` pseudo-element, I was able to amplify the prominence of list markers within my recipe page, enhancing both readability and aesthetics.

Additionally, mastering the adjustment of spacing between list markers and text content proved to be a valuable skill. By employing the `margin` properties, particularly `margin-left`, I effectively created breathing room between the marker and the accompanying text, optimizing visual balance and clarity.

Through hands-on practice and iterative refinement, I gained a deeper appreciation for the nuances of CSS styling. The process not only empowered me to elevate the presentation of my recipe page but also fostered a deeper understanding of the versatility and flexibility inherent in CSS styling techniques.
